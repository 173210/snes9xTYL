The thing you have in front of you is the result
of LOTS (nights and weekends for MANY WEEKS !)
of time spent (especially yoyofr).
It is not the result of a sudden "cool" god coming from
the sky and saying : "Hey I will give you a cool source,
compile and distribute it !".
This is a FREEWARE, you do NOT HAVE TO PAY for it.

STILL, if you really want to SUPPORT US,
please send a DONATION
Something like 5 euro or 10$ is not a big amount
of money but it can pay for our PSP expenses
and/or the restaurant when the team members meet
each other.
Having a tasty free diner with all the team members
is good memories and this is the kind of thing that
will keep our motivation up.
We known that most likely 1 people out of 20000 or
30000 will do a donation.
Don't hesitate, we hope that you will not be the
29999 others ;-).
PAYPAL Account is : ymagnien@hotmail.com

to give us something, contact us by e-mail at this 
same adress)
